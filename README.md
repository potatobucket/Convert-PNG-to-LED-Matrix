# Convert PNG or GIF to LED Matrix
 A small program to convert (small) PNGs or GIFs to hexidecimal values to use with LED matrix on an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi.

 Source image must be 12x8 pixels. White pixels mean an LED that's on/black pixels mean an LED that's off.

 GIFs are automatically generated into individual frames and an array of all the frames is generated at the end of the list
 for convenience.

## Example PNG (blown up for visibility):
 ![a white heart on a black background](/Example/heart-example.PNG)

## Example GIF (blown up for visibility):
![a small gif showing a bouncing ball](/Example/ball_bounce.gif)
