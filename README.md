# Convert PNG to LED Matrix
 A small program to convert (small) PNGs to hexidecimal values to use with LED matrix on an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi.

 Source image must be 12x8 pixels. White pixels mean an LED that's on/black pixels mean an LED that's off.

 Example (blown up for visibility):
 ![a white heart on a black background](/Example/heart-example.PNG)
